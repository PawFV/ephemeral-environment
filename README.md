# Ephemeral Development Envirnoments with Terraform

The following project creates an ephemeral environment with RDS, S3, and an ECS Fargate service for a short lived period. 

Uses Route53 to change records so it can point to randomly generated subdomains.

You'll need to adjust the variables and resource configurations according to your specific application requirements.
